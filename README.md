# playtime-unlocked

The idea for this project is to use gaming time as a reward for doing productive things that you can struggle to find motivation for.

Starting off with basic todo list functionality, but for each task you assign an amount of play time to unlock upone completeing the task. Generally these should be small amounts of time, based on how difficult you feel the task will be (or how little wyou want to do it).

When you mark a task as completed, the play time assigned to it gets added to your total. This will then countdown when you decide to play, either stopping when you do, or setting off an alarm when you run out of play time
